# VR-PAVIB: The Virtual Reality Pedestrian-Autonomous Vehicle Interactions Benchmark Suite
Autonomous vehicles (AV) is a merging theme for the advent era of future transportation.  In design, AVs are able to effectively assist humans in everyday tasks. However, one challenge prevents pedestrian-AV interactions research is that there are no public and standardized benchmarks to investigate different manners of interactions to communicate AVs’awareness and intent to pedestrians. To address the exiting limitation, this proposed work aims to include general interactive interfaces on AV and introducethe VR-PAVIB benchmark for researchers to investigate the impactof different interface features on pedestrians’ perception of the AV behavior on the road.

The project involves two main scenarios: user walking through a crossroad and user walking through a stoplight intersection.

So far this is an early prototype and work is still being done to develop the project further.
