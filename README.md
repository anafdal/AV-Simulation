# AV_Simulation_Current
Goal: Build a simulation that researchers can use to test pedestrian-autonomous vehicle interactions. To our best knowledge, there is no public and free simulation available for people to use and test their interface designs on pedestrians. So we are building a mall walking zone including stop sign and traffic lights. Work in progress. Spring 2020
